# Portfolio master branch 

To Interested persons:

I have created this repository with samples of programs.  My professional programming was performed on local intranets and are proprietary and unavailable for me to exhibit.
Most of these proprietary programs are much more complex than these examples and involve connecting to Postgres databases and displaying data back to users in various file
formats.  This will be updated as I find time to write some other examples.

This currently contains the following files:
    DisplayMap.html - An html file incorporating ESRI JavaScript API which displays a map and allows a user to select the base map used for the display.
    chatGPT.py - Python program which connects via API to chatGPT
    chatGPT.js - NodeJS program which connects via API to chatGPT
    
In the process of adding REACT, GO, and Vue samples to this branch
